# HELLO THERE! ✌🏻

I'm Jennifer, and I am here to share my journey through data storytelling.

## My Story

My journey started in a science lab where I collected data and charted the growth of plants over time with spore and how it affected the environemnt.
Overtime I transitioned to collecting student data to be able to encourage the science department to create more learning courses for students.
Now I  gather and analyze data that piques my interest or engage in freelance data analysis projects. 


## Access

Most of my projects have been converted to files that are easy to access.
